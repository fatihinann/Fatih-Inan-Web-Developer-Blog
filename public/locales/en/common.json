    "description": {
      "part1": "23 years old. I've been interested in computers since childhood; I've been involved in IT and web design since high school. I learned ASP.NET in the 11th grade and PHP in the 12th grade, then studied Computer Programming at Eskişehir Osmangazi University. I worked as a POS specialist for about 2 years, which gave me valuable experience.",
      "part2": "Technology is a big part of my life, but it's not everything. I have passions like motorcycles, guitars, cameras, and camping gear. I go to rock/metal concerts; however, returning to work is now my priority as I need financial resources to pursue my other passions.",
      "part3": "Instead of jumping from one thing to another, I created this blog site to make a solid start. I'm continuing to develop myself by applying what I've learned and aiming to gain experience and earn income through e-commerce projects in the long term."
